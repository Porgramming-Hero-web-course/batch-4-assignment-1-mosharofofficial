# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript

### Union Types:

Union types allow variables to be one of multiple types. A union Type is written as :

### const v = type1 | type2

Meaning the variable v has to be type1 or type2.

### Intersection Types:

Intersection types allow variables to have the properties of multiple types. An Intersection Type is written as :

### const v = type1 & type2

Meaning the variable v has to have all the attributes of both type1 and type2.


### Significance of Union and Intersection types 

Union and Intersection types make our code safer through strict type checking. This allows errors to be caught during compile time instead of runtime.
